## TODO.md

#### Stuff that needs to be done (feel free to open a pr/issue): 

- [ ] Verbose mode 
- [ ] Good Docs 
- [ ] Treesitter parser
- [ ] CI/CD actions
- [ ] Good status like ninja, or makefiles 
- [ ] Use a mutex to sync when using `compile` to set enviorment variable(s) before execution in sync without racing them
- [ ] Incremental rebuilds (Compilation-only) (Makefiles and Ninja support this, fairly easy to implement) 


# Finished todos: 
- [x] command flags // probably includes the next one too. (for now, needs testing) 
- [x] Language basics 
- [x] Lexer 
- [X] fix assignmet nodes  -- In most attention right now
- [x] Update the really old styled flake

# Fetch keyword 
how it should work: 
    fetch stuff from a code hosting place 
- Why:
    because I don't like C's dependency management options (vcpkg, conan)
